/**
 * The depositor's auto-compound (reinvest-rewards) preference — a live, revocable toggle over the
 * seam's `autoCompoundEnabled` / `setAutoCompound` (STE-38).
 *
 * It is NOT consent. `setPolicyConsent` is the one-time, irrevocable safety mandate (KTD3); this is
 * an economic preference the depositor may flip as often as they like, and toggling it never touches
 * `hasConsent`. Revoking it stops reinvest only — allocate, rebalance and freeze-exit are unaffected
 * (the keeper's `gateCompound` enforces that side).
 *
 * Fail-OPEN, unlike {@link useConsent}: the seam's documented default is enabled (unset = ON) and
 * reinvesting moves nothing out of the user's bucket. Rendering "Off" on a failed read would
 * misreport a user whose preference is actually ON and invite a pointless write, so an *unknown*
 * preference renders ON and logs the cause (never swallows it). The safety-critical direction is
 * already fail-closed where it matters: the keeper treats an unreadable preference as OFF and never
 * reinvests unverified.
 *
 * @param onError Surfaces a failed/declined write to the caller's toast — the mobile Account screen
 *   has a local `<Toast>`, desktop uses the global `useToast().show`, so the hook does not pick one.
