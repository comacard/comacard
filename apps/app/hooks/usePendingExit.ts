 * Two honest sources, one gate — and the two id spaces are genuinely different, which is why the
 * fixture cannot simply be deleted:
 *  - **Real mode** ⇒ `GET /pools/:id`. `proposal.toPool` came off the chain as a seam `PoolId`
 *    (`blend-eurc`), a slug `POOL_META` has never heard of: that two-entry map knows nothing about the
 *    pool the keeper actually proposed. Only the backend's catalog can name it.
 *  - **Offline** ⇒ `POOL_META`, whose ids are the local seed's (`pool-defindex-eur`).
 *
 * A failed read (a dead backend, or a pool the catalog does not carry — the route 404s rather than
 * returning `null`) falls back to the fixture, which yields `null` for an unknown id. The sheet then
 * renders its unnamed-target state; it never invents a name for a pool it could not resolve.

 * bucket with no proposal yet returns a view with `proposal: null` (the interstitial state).
