/**
 * Wire shapes of the backend HTTP surface, **re-declared** — never imported (STE-52b).
 *
 * The frontend is not a workspace dependent of `backend` and must not become one: the composed reads
 * live behind HTTP, and the only shared type package is the vault seam (`@sorosense/vault-client`,
 * which `Currency` comes from — re-declaring *that* would fork the seam).
 *
 * Each type below names the backend file it mirrors. `http.contract.test.ts` boots the real mock-mode
 * server and decodes these shapes off it, so the two cannot silently drift.
 *
 * **bigint boundary.** The backend serializes every `bigint` as a decimal **string** (one shared
 * replacer in `backend/src/http/app.ts`). The fields are typed `string` here and decoded with
 * `toBigInt()` at the edge (`client.ts`); the frontend's own bigint convention (`lib/vault/units.ts`)
 * is untouched and the string never leaks inward.
 *
 * No `risk` / `label` / `score` / `tier` field appears on any shape — safety is invisible, and the
 * backend reads carry none to begin with.
