 * The one knob that connects the frontend to the backend read surface (STE-52b, KTD2).
 *
 * Next inlines NEXT_PUBLIC_* at build time — the same pattern `lib/wallet.ts:12` uses for
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E — so an unset var makes every API branch statically dead: the app keeps its local
 * derivations (`BUCKET_META`, `getWalletBalance`) and issues **no request at all**. That is what keeps
 * vitest and Playwright offline, and what lets a backend that dies mid-demo degrade the app to
 * fixtures instead of breaking it.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no default base URL**: falling back to `http://localhost:8787` would make a
 * production build hammer a host that isn't there. Absent var ⇒ the API is off, full stop.
