/**
 * The user's **real** stablecoin balance, read from Horizon (R6 · A2).
 *
 * Why Horizon and not the vault seam: this is a classic **trustline** balance on the user's own
 * account, not vault state. `RealVaultClient` has no method for it and adding one would pollute the
 * seam. `GET /accounts/{G…}` answers both questions the deposit surface has at once — *how much do
 * they hold* and *does the trustline even exist* — and the second is exactly what the faucet's 409
 * `needsChangeTrust` path needs.
 *
 * Three outcomes the UI must tell apart, because each is a different fix for the user:
 *  - a trustline with a balance      → deposit;
 *  - **no trustline** for the asset  → "Get test funds" (the faucet mints after a `changeTrust`);
 *  - **the account does not exist**  → they need XLM first; a faucet mint cannot help them.
 *
 * Env-gated like everything else (KTD2): with `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` or the issuer unset,
 * `balanceEnabled()` is false, no request is ever issued, and `useWalletBalance` renders the fixture.
 * Client-only (KTD7) — every caller runs this inside a `useEffect`, never at module scope.
